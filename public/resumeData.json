Not only did he learn two development stacks but he would also find practical ways to implement what he had learnt to benefit the business. The crowning project was one in which he built the portal for Woolworths I.T. division. I respect Alan as he would go over and above his role consistently, finding new problems he could solve and helping others, finding best practice resolutions to whatever problem he was faced with. I would highly recommend Alan as a problem solver, team player and technologist.",
